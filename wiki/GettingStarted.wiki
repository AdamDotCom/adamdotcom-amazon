#summary Getting Started With A Code Example

= Introduction =

To use this module for your own Amazon reviews and product lists you will need to sign-up for the following:
  * An Amazon Web Service (AWS) access key. http://aws.amazon.com/
  * An Amazon Associates tag. https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/join

Then you will need to write a review or create a wishlist, and then find the following:
  * The listid you want to retrieve a list from.
  _Don't know where to find this? I found my ListId by navigating to my wishlist: http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/?id=3JU6ASKNUS7B8 then pulling out 3JU6ASKNUS7B8 (the identifier afer id= from the url)._
  * The CustomerId you want to retrieve reviews from. 
  _Don't know where to find this? I found my CustomerId by navigating to my reviews: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JM0EQJELFL69/ then pulling out A2JM0EQJELFL69 (the last element of the url)._

= Example =

{{{

//Hydrate the request object with your Amazon details
IAmazonRequest amazonRequest = new AmazonRequest();
amazonRequest.AssociateTag = "adamkahtavaap-20";
amazonRequest.AWSAccessKeyId = "1MRFMGASE6CQKS2WTMR2";
amazonRequest.CustomerId = "A2JM0EQJELFL69";
amazonRequest.ListId = "3JU6ASKNUS7B8";

//Hydrate your file parameter object with your file details (where you want the files saved to)
IFileParameters fileParameters = new FileParameters();

string folderPath = Path.Combine(HttpContext.Current.Request.PhysicalApplicationPath, "Xml");
fileParameters.ProductFileNameAndPath = folderPath + @"\Products.xml";
fileParameters.ReviewFileNameAndPath = folderPath + @"\Reviews.xml";
fileParameters.ErrorFileNameAndPath = folderPath + @"\Errors.xml";

IAmazonApplication amazonApplication = new AmazonApplication(amazonRequest, fileParameters);

//
amazonApplication.Save();

}}}

  Once the code is persisted to your local environment you can consume it. I've loaded mine into a couple repeaters which can be viewed here: http://adam.kahtava.com/codesamples/adamdotcom.amazon/samplewebapp/default.aspx
